### THIS REPO IS JUST A TEST APP

#### DEMO
 - https://practical-lichterman-0be83d.netlify.com/

I choose reactjs as a frontend library because of its feature, a large community, simplicity, maintainable and matured library. In UI framework i choose antdesign because of its awesome documentation and a lots of cool components, also its matured and nice community. 


##### i used my very own react-starter-kit-ts,
 - to run this app please check the readme
https://github.com/juztinlazaro/react-starter-kit/blob/master/README.md

Note:
I used my react-starter-kit-ts, but right now i don't have a time to create a documentation. Hopefully soon i can write a documentation for this repo.
 https://github.com/juztinlazaro/react-starter-kit-ts but some of the documentation is almost in the react-starter-kit https://github.com/juztinlazaro/react-starter-kit/wiki
